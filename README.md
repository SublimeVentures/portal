Hey man the site looks really good and stoked to see it on mobile! One issue I did notice was a pretty consistent resizing of the browser when I was checking it out before I connected my wallet. After connecting my wallet the interface was smooth like butter. I was using MetaMask’s in app browser on an iPhone.
