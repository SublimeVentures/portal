                            The risk of loss in holding any cryptocurrencies can be substantial. You should therefore
                            carefully consider whether investing in or holding any crypto tokens is suitable for you in
                            light of your financial condition. In considering whether to invest or hold any crypto
                            tokens, you should be aware that the price or value of cryptocurrencies can change rapidly,
                            decrease, and potentially even fall to zero. Tokens or any cryptocurrencies are not issued
                            by any central banks or national, supra-national, or quasi-national organizations. They are
                            also not backed by any hard assets or other credit. The value of tokens or any
                            cryptocurrencies is affected by several factors, including but not limited to, the total
                            number of tokens or any cryptocurrencies in existence, the continued willingness of market
                            participants to exchange government-issued currency for tokens or cryptocurrencies ,
                            purchasers’ expectations with respect to the rate of inflation of fiat currencies,
                            purchasers’ expectations with respect to the rate of deflation of cryptocurrencies, interest
                            rates, currency exchange rates, cyber theft of cryptocurrencies from online crypto wallet
                            providers, or news of such theft from such providers or individuals’ crypto wallets,
                            investment and trading activities of large investors, monetary policies of the governments,
                            trade restrictions, currency devaluations and revaluations, regulatory measures, the global
                            or regional political, economic or financial events and situations. Thus, all these factors
                            will affect the value of tokens or cryptocurrencies, which may result in the permanent
                            partial or total loss of the value of a particular tokens or cryptocurrency. No one will be
                            obliged to guarantee the liquidity or the market price of any of the Token or
                            cryptocurrencies maintained into your Wallets. The volatility and unpredictability of the
                            value of tokens or cryptocurrencies relative to the government-issued currency may result in
                            a significant loss over a short period of time. When using a Website and Services you
                            acknowledge that BasedVC is not responsible for any losses resulting from market changes or
